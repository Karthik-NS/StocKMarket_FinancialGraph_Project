StocKMarket_FinancialGraph_Project using PANDAS and BOKEH

Datavisualization project for showing StockMarket Financial Graph using pandas dataframes and Bokeh libraries
Notes:

In this project we are showing financial graph, for stock market using CandleStick Chart using Pandas and Bokeh libraries.

Candlestick charts are used by traders to determine possible price movement based on past patterns.

Candlesticks are useful when trading as they show four price points (open, close, high, and low) throughout the period of time the trader specifies.

Just like a bar chart, a daily candlestick shows the market's open, high, low, and close price for the day. The candlestick has a wide part, which is called the "real body."

This real body represents the price range between the open and close of that day's trading. When the real body(called as Bearish candle) is filled in red, it means the close was lower than the open. If the real body is green(Bullish candle), it means the close was higher than the open.

 I'm using  Apple stock data for year 2019 in this project to show Financial Graph.
